Exploration workflow for research and spikes.

Use when:
- Investigating new technology
- Evaluating approaches
- Prototyping solutions
- Answering technical questions

This is a WISP workflow - results may be burned or squashed.

Gather information.

Methods:

Build a minimal prototype if needed.

Guidelines:
- Quick and dirty is OK
- Focus on learning, not production quality
- Document discoveries
- Note blockers and unknowns

Decide what to do with results.

Options:
1. SQUASH - Compress into permanent record

2. BURN - Discard if dead end
   bd mol burn <wisp-id>

3. PROMOTE - Convert to feature work
   Create Beads issue for implementation
